do not forget the plan is there will be a user table for customers,druggists and phamrmacy admins, in which are related to specific pharmacies through pharmacy_id null fotr the customer
orders table only for online orders, after placing order it should be recored as a sale item in sales table 
notifications must be auto push notifications, notifications only approved by pharmacy_admin/druggist we need to clarify as we store both type of users in user tbale, and at the time of gigvng permissios, we need modify them accordingly implement which is easy
prescriptions must be approved by the druggist, aftert eht the prescription officially is a medical record,
add an extra field of diagnosis to the prescription table which is optional

Plan:
30-03-2025
there is a obstacle of ccreating databses which is restricted in cloud(most of them)
Implemet multi db in local host,
implement RBAC in a single DB to deploy the application,
OR the DEPLOYEMENT, create a certain like 10 active pharmacy databases and assign them to the registered Databases if possible, or else the whole backend should be remmodeled from scratch , i mean you have a lot of documentation, and a complete DAY is required with atleast 4-5 concentrated hours
