# PharmaEase Frontend

Creating a front-end of PharmaEase using Vite involves building the user interface of the PharmaEase Frontend website using Vite, React components, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are the high-level steps you can follow to create a front-end of PharmaEase  using Vite:

1. Set up your development environment by installing Node.js and creating a new Vite project using `npm init vite@latest`.

2. Create a mockup or wireframe of the PharmaEase Frontend website to guide your development. This step involves deciding on the layout, color scheme, and user interface components to use.

3. Start building the user interface by creating the header, footer, and navigation components. You can use existing React component libraries or build your own components.

4. Create the main sections of the website, such as the home page, product listing pages, and product details page. You can use placeholders or mock data initially and replace them with real data later.

5. Implement responsive design using media queries, flexbox, and other CSS techniques to ensure that your PharmaEase Frontend looks good on all screen sizes.

6. Add interactivity to your PharmaEase Frontend using React and JavaScript. This step involves implementing features such as search, sorting, filtering, and pagination.

7. Implement state management using React hooks or a state management library such as Redux or MobX.

8. Test your PharmaEase Frontend thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. This step involves testing the user interface and user flows.

9. Build your PharmaEase Frontend using Vite using the `npm run build` command.

10. Deploy your PharmaEase Frontend to a hosting provider such as Netlify or Vercel to make it accessible to the public.

Note that creating a front-end of PharmaEase Frontend using Vite is still a challenging project that involves many components, so you may need to break down each step into smaller sub-steps and spend time debugging and troubleshooting as you go. You may also need to use third-party APIs or mock data to simulate the behavior of the PharmaEase Frontend website.
